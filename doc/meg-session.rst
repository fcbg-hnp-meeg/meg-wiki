MEG session
===========

Screening
---------

An MEG session starts by screening the participant to ensure his compatibility with
MEG acquisition. An MEG measures fields in the range of ``fT``, i.e. ``e-15`` Tesla.
Thus, it's very sensitive to any magnetic metal or alloy in movement within the
Magnetically Shielded Room (MSR). For instance, the ticking of the second's needle of a
mechanical watch is picked up 2 meters from the sensors.

During screening, the participant is positionned in the MEG and the signal is monitored
for a short period of time. Screening is an iterative process where we try to identify
and remove all sources of interference. Common sources of interference are: braces,
dental retainers, piercings, make-up, bra.

.. note::

    Participants will change into MEG-compatible clothes, thus removing belts, jeans,
    bras and other clothes with metalic pieces.

If the interference source can not be removed, e.g. implants or dental retainers, the
decision to continue or cancel the acquisition belongs to the researcher.
