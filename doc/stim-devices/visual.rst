ProPixx projector
-----------------

The MEG uses a `ProPixx projector`_ from the company VPixx to display images in the
magnetically shielded room (MSR). This projector uses LED as a light source, giving a
larger color gammut.

The projector is connected as the second monitor of the :ref:`stim-pc:Stimulation PC`. A
control monitor duplicates the image displayed by the projector in the control room.
