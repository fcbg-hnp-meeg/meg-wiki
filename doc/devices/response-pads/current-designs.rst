===============

Response devices from `Current Designs`_ are available through the `932 interface`_.
This interface can simultaneously translate responses as keyboard inputs for the
:ref:`stim-pc:Stimulation PC` and as TTL pulses on MEG trigger channels.

``1x4`` and ``2x4`` curved response buttons are commonly used. A full list of compatible
response devices can be found `here <response-devices_>`_.
