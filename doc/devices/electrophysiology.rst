Electroencaphalography (EEG)
----------------------------

BIO channels
------------

The MEG system can record from 12 bipolar channels, also called ``BIO`` channels. The
``BIO`` channels can be set to record EOG, ECG, EMG, or any other bipolar montage.

.. note::

    MEGIN and its FIFF format can store the channel type information for EOG, ECG and
    EMG channels. To do so, in the :ref:`meg-settings:Channel selection` panel, click
    on ``Edit BIO``.
