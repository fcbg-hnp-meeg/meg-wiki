Contraindications for MEG
=========================

Since the signal measured by a MEG system is extremely low (10e-15 T), the machine is very restrictive with potential artefacts-creating elements. **Being compatible for an fMRI examination doesn't mean being compatible for MEG.** 
                                                           
- Pace-maker (cardiac stimulator)
- Insulin pump, bladder neurostimulator, or any implanted device
- Cardiac valve (mechanical or animal)
- Hearing aid - ear implant
- Joint prosthesis (hip, knee, shoulder, etc.) *1*
- Neurosurgical clip for brain aneurysm
- Orthodontic equipment, dental prosthesis, dental retainer *2*
- Sutures with metal wires or staples
- Non-removable piercings/ear rings etc.
- Tattoos *1*
- Permanent makeup/eye makeup *3*
- Recent hair color, any kind of hair extensions
- Dread locks/rastas (MEG's helmet is quite narrow)
- Hair/beard must be clean *4*
- Foreign object in the eye
- Shrapnel or metal object in the body
- Filter in the vena cava to prevent pulmonary embolism
- Recent MRI examination (less than two weeks) *5*
- Metal workers or construction workers working with metal *5*
- Recent surgeries *5*

                                                           
1: May depend on material/localization. It’s safer to avoid these but if he/she’s available, the participant can come to do a brief test in the lab to check compatibility (10 minutes) before booking a real slot (ask MEG staff for lab’s availability). Tattoos below the elbow that doesn’t move with breathing are usually safe.

2: Any kind of dental work should be avoided, but some synthetic material devices (dental retainers) are compatible. If he/she’s available, the participant can come to do a brief test in the lab to check compatibility (10 minutes) before booking a real slot (ask MEG staff for lab’s availability).

3: We do have makeup remover at the lab, but it’s safer to ask the participants to come without any makeup

4: We do have a hair wash sink, but it’s safer (and saves time) if the participant cleaned hair and beard in the morning before the exam

5: In case of doubt, if he/she’s available the participant can come to do a brief test to check compatibility in the lab (10 minutes) before booking a real slot (check with MEG staff for lab’s availability).
